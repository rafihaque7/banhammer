What does the program do?
It goes through a filtering process to make the world a better place. For writing specific vulgar words, you will immediately go
to Jail. For some words, it will suggest a better word to use to save feelings of other people.

How to use the program?
Type "make" or "make all" to compile the program
Type "./banhammer <Espernto.txt" to read Esperanto.txt as the input file
Type "./banhammer" to read from the standard in.

Here are all the flags:
-s will suppress the letter form the censor, and instead print the statistics that were computed.
-h size specifies that has table will have size entries(the default will be 10000)
-f size specifies that the Bloom filter will have size entries (default will be 2^20)
-m will use the move-to-front rule.
-b will not use the move-to-front rule (default)

EX. "./banhammer -h 200 <Esperanto.txt"
